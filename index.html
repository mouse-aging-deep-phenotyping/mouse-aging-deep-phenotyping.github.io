    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Aging of biological systems is pervasive and affects almost all existing organisms. Importantly, aging
        constitutes a major risk factor for a wide variety of disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.,
        Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease), cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial infarct, stroke) and
        cancers. Therapeutic targeting of the aging process may hence represent an innovative approach for the
        development of treatments that are broadly effective against a range of aging-associated diseases.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Previous work has identified a number of genetic (e.g., loss-of-function mutation in the mTOR gene), dietary
        (e.g., dietary restriction) and pharmacological (e.g., the FDA-approved mTOR inhibitor rapamycin) interventions
        that significantly extend natural lifespan in laboratory mice, suggesting that these manipulations might
        potentially interact with the aging process. In previous work, we have examined the effects of some of these
        interventions on age-related changes across hundreds of phenotypes in mice (Neff et al. 2013; Ehninger et al.,
        2014; Xie et al., 2017). Our findings revealed that these treatments indeed counteracted some (but not all)
        age-dependent phenotypic changes. Interestingly, short-term treatment of young animals often had similar effects
        on those phenotypes, suggesting that these ‘anti-aging’ treatments may work by shifting the baseline levels of
        these phenotypes, rather than by altering the rate of age-dependent phenotypic change.</p>
